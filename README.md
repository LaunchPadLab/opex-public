# OPEX

Opex is an internal organization that focuses on improving the tri-fold objectives of **development speed**, **code quality** and **developer experience** at LaunchPad Lab.

This repository is Opex's home base! It contains the following resources:
1. [A list of Opex-maintained "internal open source" projects](#projects).
1. [A collection of Github issues containing ideas and planned enhancement to Opex projects](#issues).
1. [A few gists that document our standard development practices](#gists).

## Projects

The following projects are "internal open source" at Launchpad. That means that they were created at LPL and will continue to be maintained by the Opex team. Just like with other open source projects, contributions from any developer to these repositories  are welcome!

**Note**: Open source visibility is defined in two ways: *transparency* and *community owned*. We default to our libraries and code being open sourced for the sake of transparency but is maintained by our team and not the larger community. There are exceptions where a library seeks out community involvement and code updates (ex. [Decanter](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/decanter)), but that is part of a conscious and intentional decision by the Opex team.

## Issues

The [issues](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/opex/issues) in this repository contain ideas and planned enhancements for Opex-maintained libraries. Feel free to contribute to the discussion on these issues, or if you have an idea that isn't represented yet, create your own! Creating an issue does not mean you'll need to implement anything yourself, it simply opens it up a topic for discussion.

Each month, a few of these issues are pulled into a **monthly Github milestone**, which flags them as a priority for Opex team. If you'd like to work on an issue in a milestone, please coordinate with the Opex team on how to tackle the issue together.

## Gists

One function of Opex is to set standard processes by which we do our work. These processes are documented in the [gists](gists) folder of this repository. 

These documents are fairly limited in scope and there are few of them by design. This prevents information overload and encourages us to encapsulate as many of our best practices as possible in our app template repositories. Still, they may come in handy as a general reference / anti-bikeshedding tool.
