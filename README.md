# Operational Excellence

## Summary

### Definition
> Operational Excellence is an element of organizational leadership that focuses on meeting **customer expectation**, all while stressing the application of a variety of **principles, systems, and tools** toward the **sustainable improvement** of key performance **metrics**.  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_excellence) (*emphasis added*)

### Principles
Guidelines for designing systems and choosing tools that will maximize our ability to meet and exceed our internal and external expections. Whenever there is a choice to be made, we can fallback on our principles to help make the decision.

### Systems
Processes that ensure internal and external expectations are consistently met across projects, clients, space, and time. This includes standards, infrastructure, communication protocols and well-defined responsibilities.

### Tools
Services and libraries used to implement our Systems. These will be in constant flux, but will always reflect the application of our Principles to the current state of our knowledge and situation.

### What about our "Proficiencies"?
They're still [here](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/process/tree/master/Proficiencies) and we will continue to use them to flesh out the details.

### How will we achieve this?
Cooperatively, incrementally, and organically! The process is the goal so we can all pitch in starting with the lowest hanging fruit.
